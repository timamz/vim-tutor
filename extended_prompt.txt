To construct Vim commands using basic symbols, follow these guidelines:

### Vim Command Syntax

A typical Vim command follows this structure:

```
[count] operator [count] motion
```

- **count**: An optional number specifying how many times to apply the operator or motion.
- **operator**: The action to perform (e.g., delete, change, yank).
- **motion**: The movement that defines the range of text the operator will act upon.

The first count applies to the operator, determining how many times the operation is performed. The second count applies to the motion, extending its range.

---

### Combining Operators and Motions

Operators modify text, while motions define the scope of that modification. By combining them, you can perform complex edits efficiently.

For example:

- `d2w`: Delete the next two words.
- `3y$`: Yank from the current position to the end of the line, three times.

In these examples, the count before the operator (`3` in `3y$`) determines how many times the operation is performed, while the count within the motion (`2` in `d2w`) specifies the extent of the motion.

---

### Text Objects

Text objects represent logical blocks of text and can be used with operators. They follow the pattern:

```
operator [count] text_object
```


Examples include:

- `ciw`: Change inner word.
- `yap`: Yank a paragraph, including surrounding whitespace.
- `di"`: Delete inside double quotes.

Here, the operator (`c`, `y`, `d`) acts upon the specified text object (`iw`, `ap`, `i"`), optionally repeated by the count.

---

### Visual Mode

Visual mode allows for manual selection:

- `v`: Character-wise selection.
- `V`: Line-wise selection.
- `Ctrl+v`: Block-wise selection.

Once a selection is made, operators can be applied directly:

- `d`: Delete selection.
- `y`: Yank selection.
- `>`: Indent selection.

Now, answer concisely:
How to {description} using Vim motions?
Write only the symbol sequence representing the Vim motion. Don't use spaces in your answer.
Combination of control and <symbol> should be written as 'Ctrl+<symbol>'.
